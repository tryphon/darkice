1. Compiling and installing
---------------------------

On how to compile and install, please read the file INSTALL. If you're
impatient, try:

./configure
make
make install

The executable built is src/darkice.

For command line syntax, try:

darkice --help



2. Configuration file format
----------------------------

DarkIce requires a configuration file. Please take a look at the supplied
darkice.cfg sample configuration file.

The file has to following general format:

[section1]
# this is a whole line comment
key = value
an ugly key name = long value    # this end is a comment too

[section2]
# this is a whole line comment in section 2
key = value
an ugly key name = long value    # this end is a comment too


In particular, the following sections and values are required:


2.1 Section [general]
---------------------
This section describes general operational parameters.

Required values:

duration        Time for DarkIce to run, in seconds.
bufferSecs      Data read from the sound card is buffered before sent to
                the mp3 encoder. Each buffer will be able to hold this
                many seconds of samples.


2.2 Section [input]
---------------------
This section describes the input.

Required values:

device          OSS DSP audio device to record from (e.g. /dev/dsp)
sampleRate      The sample rate to record with, samples per second
                (e.g. 44100 for 44.1kHz CD-quality audio)
bitsPerSample   Bites to use for each sample (e.g. 8 bits or 16 bits)
channel         Number of channels to record (e.g. 1 for mono, 2 for stereo)


2.3 Section [lamex]
---------------------
This section describes an output to an IceCast server, while encoding
with a lame encoder. There may be at most 8 outputs, numbered from 0 ... 7.
The number is included in the section name (e.g. [lame0] ... [lame7]).

Required values:

encoder         The command used to invoke the encoder
bitrate         Bit rate to encode to in kBits / sec (e.g. 96)
server          The IceCast server's name (e.g. yp.sourserver.com)
port            The port to connect to the IceCast server (e.g. 8000)
password        The password to use to connet to the IceCast server
mountPoint      Mount point for the stream on the server
name            Name of the stream
description     Description of the stream
url             Url related to the stream
genre           Genre of the stream
public          "yes" or "no", wether the stream is public

Optional values:

remoteDumpFile  The file the IceCast server should dump the contents of
                this stream on its side.
lowpass         Lowpass filter setting for the lame encoder. If not set,
                the encoder's default behaviour is used
highpass        Highpass filter setting for the lame encoder. If not set,
                the encoder's default behaviour is used



3. Supported encoders
---------------------

Currently the lame encoder is supported (http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/).
Tests were made with version 3.86.



4. Kown bugs and issues
-----------------------

Lots of bugs, this is the first release.

You must have write permissions in the directory you execute DarkIce.
It is recommended to run DarkIce as root, with a nice level of -10.
