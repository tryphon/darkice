1. What is DarkIce?
-------------------

DarkIce is an IceCast, IceCast2 and ShoutCast live audio streamer. It
takes audio input from a sound card, encodes it into mp3 and/or Ogg Vorbis,
and sends the mp3 stream to one or more IceCast and/or ShoutCast servers,
the Ogg Vorbis stream to one or more IceCast2 servers.

DarkIce is hosted on SourceForge, at http://darkice.sourceforge.net/


2. Compiling and installing

On how to compile and install, please read the file INSTALL. If you're
impatient, try:
