Installing DarkIce
------------------

If you're reading this, you probably have downloaded and extracted the
DarkIce tarball. Go to the directory you extracted it, and try:

./configure --help

This will give you all the compile configuration options.

On Solaris systems, for some reason the configure script does not
find the include file lame/lame.h if it uses the SUN Workshop C compiler
as a preprocessor for testing. Therefore you might consider setting:

export CPP="gcc -E"

This hack is not needed on other systems.

If chosing the default compile options, issue the following commands:

./configure
make
make install

For the last step, you need to be root or have write permissions in the
target directories, usually directories under /usr/local.

Now you should have DarkIce installed. For documentation, try

man darkice

To try out the program, try

darkice -h
