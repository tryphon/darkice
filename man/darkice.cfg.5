.SH NAME
darkice.cfg \- configuration file for darkice
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The configuration file consists of sections, with key = value pairs
separated with spaces and/or tabs inside each secion:

.nf
[section1]
# this is a whole line comment
key = value
an ugly key name = long value    # this end is a comment too

[section2]
# this is a whole line comment in section 2
key = value
an ugly key name = long value    # this end is a comment too
.fi

A proper
.B DarkIce
configuration file contains the following sections:
.nf
[general]
[input]
[icecast-0] ... [icecast-7]
[icecast2-0] ... [icecast2-7]
[shoutcast-0] ... [shoutcast-7]
.fi

The order of the sections is not important. Sections [general] and [input]
are required, and at least one of [icecast-x], [icecast2-x]

A sample configuration file follows. This file makes
.B DarkIce
stream for 1 minute (60 seconds) from the audio device
.I /dev/dsp
at 22.05kHz, 16 bit stereo.
It will build up a connection to the
.B IceCast
server yp.yourserver.com on port 8000 with the password "hackme".
The stream will be encoded to 96 kb/s mp3, and will be reachable at
.I http://yp.yourserver.com:8000/live96
to mp3 players.
The encoding session will be stored by
.B IceCast
in the file
.I /tmp/live96.mp3
on the server side.

bufferSecs      = 5

A bit more complicated sample follows. This one makes
.B DarkIce
stream for 1 hour (3600 seconds) from the audio device
.I /dev/dsp
at 44.1kHz, 16 bit stereo.

It will build up a connection to an
.B IceCast
server yp.your-ice-server.com on port 8000 with the password "ice-hackme".
The sound for this stream will be cut at 10500 Hz from above.
The stream will be encoded to 96 kb/s mp3 and resampled to 22.05kHz.
The stream will be reachable at
.I http://yp.your-ice-server.com:8000/live96
to mp3 players.
The encoding session will be stored by
.B IceCast
in the file
.I /tmp/live96.mp3
on the server side.

It will also connect to a
.I ShoutCast
server at yp.your-shout-server.com on port 8001 with the password "shout-hackme"
This stream will be encoded to 128 kb/s mp3, and will be reachable at
.I http://yp.your-shout-server.com:8000
to mp3 players.
